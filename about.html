<h2>What I do.</h2>
<p> I am a creative and marketing leader with over 15 years of professional experience in marketing, project management and creative development.</p>
	
<p>I currently manage a team of over 10+ graphic and production artists for grocery-retail client located in the Phoenix, Arizona metropolitian area. </p>


<h2>Who I am.</h2>
<p>An extrovert since birth, I'm curious about everything. I love to know and explore everything from travel, photography, food, pretty product packaging, people - I'm drawn to all matters of design and movement.</p>

<p> I was born in Detroit, Michigan. At the age of 9, my family moved from Michigan to the bustling city of St. Paul, Minnesota. Shortly after our arrival in St. Paul, my parents moved us to Eden Prairie, Minnesota - a rural town that quickly grew into one of the fastest suburbs in the Twin Cities. A vast cultural difference from anything I had ever known. My upbrining in Eden Prarie inspired me to want to learn more about the world that I live in. I have a natural curosity in the diversity of people, my passion for wanting to understand the why's and how's and who's...this also explains my love of science fiction. I'm a true sci-fi geek at heart.</p>

<p>I have an double undergraduate degree in Marketing Management and Business Communication from the University of St. Thomas. I'm currently purusing a post-baccalaureate Interactive Design and Marketing Certificate from the Minneapolis College of Art and Design. I now live in Phoenix, Arizona, and taking every opportunity I can to explore my new home in the desert. When I'm not working or studying, I love spending time with family and friends and giving my digital camera a workout.</p>
